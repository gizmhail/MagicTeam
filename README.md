This game is (currently!) being developed for the Global Game Jam 2016

# Principle 
The game is a mix between Magicka and Spaceteam, very inspired by this later.
Indeed, as with Spaceteam, the goal of the game is to achieve a maximum auditive chaos ^_^

It is a cooperative game, where you are, with your friends, a team of mages.
You have to cast spells to fight your foes, and only some spells can hurt a given ennemy.
To cast a spell, you have to send each arcane symbols in the proper order, as written in the bestiary (where for a given creature, the appropriate spell is given)

...but there is a twist: your bestiary does NOT contain your spells, but the spells of your teamates.
And thus, you are obliged to quickly communicate together outside of the video game, by whisping/telling/YELLING the commands to your teamates

(in progress) As you progress among levels, the simple arcane symbols called "letters" will be replaced by (kitten) images, complex symbol, audio symbols, ....
