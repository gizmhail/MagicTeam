This game is (currently!) being developed for the Global Game Jam 2016

== Principle ==
The game will be a mix between Magicka and Spaceteam.
Indeed, the goal of the game is to achieve a maximum auditive chaos ^_^

It is a cooperative game, where you are, with your friends, a team of mages.
You have to cast spells to fight your foes, and only some spells can hurt a given ennemy.
To cast a spell, you have to send each arcane symbol in the proper order, as written in the bestiary (where for a give creature, the appropriate spell is given)

...but there is a twist: your bestiary does NOT contain your spells, but the spells of your teamates.
And thus, you are obliged to quickly communicate together outside of the video given, by whisping/telling/HURLING the commands to your teamtes

As you progress among levels, the simple arcane symbols called "letters" will be replaced by (kitten) images, complex symbol, audio symbols, ....
